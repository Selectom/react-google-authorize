> A Google OAuth Component for React that supports multiple instances

Developed in [Selectom](https://www.selectom.com).

## Install

```
yarn add react-google-authorize
```

**Why yet another React Google oauth component?**

All existing React Google oauth components (e.g. [react-google-login](https://github.com/anthonyjgrove/react-google-login), which is the basis of this library, and also [react-google-login-component](https://github.com/kennetpostigo/react-google-login-component), [react-google-oauth](https://github.com/CyrilSiman/react-google-oauth) and [react-social-login](https://github.com/deepakaggarwal7/react-social-login)) use the [gapi.auth2.init](https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/web/reference#gapiauth2initparams) method for handling the authentication and authorization process, which has the limitation of only supporting one button in the document at a time.

We needed to support multiple authorization buttons, potentially for different Google user accounts, so we implemented this control to use the [gapi.auth2.authorize](https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/web/reference#gapiauth2authorizeparams-callback) method instead.
This means that you don't get a GoogleUser object to play with, but you can request authorization from different users at the same time.


## How to use
```js
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import GoogleAuthorize from 'react-google-authorize';
// or
import { GoogleAuthorize } from 'react-google-authorize';


const responseGoogle = (response) => {
  console.log(response);
}

ReactDOM.render(
  <GoogleAuthorize
    clientId="815121234598-5nn3e2ftm5hobdjbemuappb2t112345.apps.googleusercontent.com"
    buttonText="Authorize"
    onSuccess={responseGoogle}
    onFailure={responseGoogle}
  />,
  document.getElementById('googleButton')
);
```

## onSuccess callback

Argument to the callback with be the [AuthorizeResponse](https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/web/reference#gapiauth2authorizeresponse) object.

If you use the hostedDomain param, make sure to validate the id_token (a JSON web token) returned by Google on your backend server:
 1. In the `responseGoogle(response) {...}` callback function, you should get back a standard JWT located at `response.hg.id_token`
 2. Send this token to your server (preferably as an `Authorization` header)
 3. Have your server decode the id_token by using a common JWT library such as [jwt-simple](https://github.com/hokaccha/node-jwt-simple) or by sending a GET request to `https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v3/tokeninfo?id_token=YOUR_TOKEN_HERE`
 4. The returned decoded token should have an `hd` key equal to the hosted domain you'd like to restrict to.

You can also pass child components such as icons into the button component.
```js
  <GoogleAuthorize
    clientId={'815121234598-5nn3e2ftm5hobdjbemuappb2t112345.apps.googleusercontent.com'}
    onSuccess={responseGoogle}
    onFailure={responseGoogle}
  >
    <FontAwesome
      name='google'
    />
    <span> Login with Google</span>
  </GoogleAuthorize>

```


## onFailure callback

onFailure callback is called when either initialization or a authorization attempt fails.
Argument is an error object.

Common error codes include:

| error code | description |
|:----------:|:-----------:|
| `idpiframe_initialization_failed` | initialization of the Google Auth API failed (this will occur if a client doesn't have [third party cookies enabled](https://github.com/google/google-api-javascript-client/issues/260)) |
| `popup_closed_by_user` | The user closed the popup before finishing the sign in flow.|
| `access_denied` | The user denied the permission to the scopes required |
| `immediate_failed` | No user could be automatically selected without prompting the consent flow. |
